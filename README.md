## Description

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/deep-web-solutions/wordpress-framework-helpers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/deep-web-solutions/wordpress-framework-helpers)
[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/b777a17778d2969dfa84/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/deep-web-solutions/wordpress-framework-helpers/maintainability)

A set of helpers to kick-start WordPress development. This package is designed to contain small, helpful, static snippets 
that can be reused throughout different projects.


## Installation

The package is designed to be installed via Composer. It may work as a stand-alone but that is not officially supported.
The package's name is `deep-web-solutions/wp-framework-helpers`.

If the package will be used outside a composer-based installation, e.g. inside a regular WP plugin, you should install
using the `--ignore-platform-reqs` option. If you don't do that, the bundled `DWS WordPress Framework - Bootstrapper` package 
will only be able to perform checks for the WordPress version because composer will throw an error in case of an incompatible PHP version.

## Contributing

Contributions both in the form of bug-reports and pull requests are more than welcome!


## Frequently Asked Questions

- Will you support earlier versions of WordPress and PHP?

Unfortunately not. PHP 7.3 is close to EOL (March 2021), and we consider 7.4 to provide a few features that are absolutely amazing.
Moreover, WP 5.5 introduced a few new features that we really want to use as well, and we consider it to be one of the first versions
of WordPress to have packed a more-or-less mature version of Gutenberg.

If you're using older versions of either one, you should really consider upgrading at least for security reasons.

- Is this bug-free?

Hopefully yes, probably not. If you found any problems, please raise an issue on Github!

## Frequently Asked Questions 

* What does this plugin do?

This WP plugin doesn't really have a use on its own. It was built as an empty shell that hosts other DWS WordPress Framework
libraries in Codeception tests on Travis CI.

* How do I use this?

This answer will explain how to prepare the plugin for testing a DWS WordPress Framework.

Clone this repository inside the library's /tests/_support folder (preferably inside a 'plugins' sub-folder). Modify
the 'composer.json' file to require the DWS library you want to test (you probably want to use the 'master@dev' dependency
version) and any dependencies you still need.

Configure your Travis-CI configuration file for the DWS library to install WordPress, copy and activate your _support copy
of the plugin inside WP's plugins folders, and whatever else you need to run the tests on the current version of the library.
